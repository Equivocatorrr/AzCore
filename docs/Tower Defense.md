# Tower Defense

## Ideas
- Honkers don't stun
- Guaranteed honker spawns every 5 or 10 waves?
- Segments are 10 waves a piece
- Each segment introduces a new type of enemy:
    1. Regular Enemies
    2. Honkers
    3. Spiraling Boys (Orbiters)
    4. Stunners
    5. ~????????~
- Background changes at the beginning of a new segment:
    1. Blue
    2. Green
    3. Purple
    4. Teal
    5. Red
    6. ~?????~
- Segment 2 starts with guaranteed honker and first instrument is foghorn.
- The core has fixed health, but upgradeable shields.
- Shields regen slowly during the wave, but gets fully recharged at the beginning of a wave.
- Core gets smaller with less health.
- Core starts with a lot of health, but you can be easily crippled early on because fundsss.

## ToDos
- Give segment 1 song a 10th wave (because I can't count lol)
