## Torch Bearer
You're the sacred bearer of a flame that needs to be brought to multiple locations in a treacherous world full of obstacles.

Maybe this torch is just that thing from Avatar where they use fire bending to keep the flame balanced.

You have a gas resource that you can use as a weapon or to fly as a jetpack.
